# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration Status

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Core MCP System Implementation
- Created generic repository pattern with type parameters `Repository[T, F, U]`
- Implemented automatic OpenAI tool generation from repository schemas
- Built reflection-based command handler for CRUD operations
- Resolved import cycles through package separation

### 2. Tag Repository Integration
- Created `TagRepositoryAdapter` bridging existing `SqlTagStore` to MCP interface
- Implemented comprehensive type conversions between protobuf and domain types
- Added custom JSON unmarshaling for enum handling (TagType, ContextType, ContentRating)
- Full support for all tag filtering operations

### 3. ChatService Integration
- Completely replaced old router/tools system with MCP
- Maintained backwards compatibility with existing API
- Preserved conversation history management
- Integrated with existing authentication and middleware

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed OpenAI API integration (removed incompatible JSON response format with tools)
- Fixed enum marshaling issues with custom UnmarshalJSON method
- Improved AI system prompt for better tool selection

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

### Working Features
- âœ… Natural language to CRUD operations
- âœ… Tag counting with filters
- âœ… Tag finding with multiple filter types
- âœ… Enum-based filtering (Category, Topic, etc.)
- âœ… Boolean filters (public/private, hasChildren, isRoot)
- âœ… Pagination (limit/offset)
- âœ… AI-powered intent recognition

### Test Results
All tag operations tested and working:
- Count operations
- Public/private filtering
- Type-based filtering (Category, Topic, UserContent, etc.)
- Structure filtering (root tags, with/without children)
- Combined filters
- Edge cases

## ðŸš€ Production Ready

The MCP integration for tags is fully functional and ready for production use. The system provides:
- Type-safe operations replacing brittle string parameters
- Auto-generated tools reducing maintenance
- Consistent patterns across domains
- Easy extensibility for new operations

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (When Needed)

1. **Add More Domains**
   - User repository (basic structure created but not integrated)
   - Question repository
   - Interaction repository

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Batch operations support
   - Advanced search integration
   - Custom domain-specific operations

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Response caching
   - Query optimization
   - Parallel operation execution

## ðŸ”§ Usage

The MCP system is now the default for the ChatService. Simply send natural language requests:

```
"how many tags are there?"
"find public category tags"
"show me root tags with children"
"find tags of type UserContent, limit to 10"
```

All requests are automatically converted to the appropriate typed operations.
